# NetChaziz
NetChaziz is a Internet Explorer Compatible(1) Browser and is expanding to also be a File Explorer as well. And also there's plans for a mini-Media Player.

It currently requires .NET Framework 3.0 to be installed (should be included on Windows 7+), which makes it able to run on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 but won't be usable with today's internet because IE8 is old and doesn't support HTML5 correctly.

It is currently only tested on the almost-lastest build of Windows 10 Home Insider preview.

It should be also be noted that NetChaziz is NOT complete and is in alpha.

(1) "Compatible" in this setence means "clone", as in "IBM PC compatible".
