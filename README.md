# NetChaziz
NetChaziz is a Internet Explorer Compatible(1) Browser and is expanding to also be a File Explorer as well. And also there's plans for a mini-Media Player.

It currently requires .NET Framework 4.0 to be installed. It does work on Windows XP. https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/p/dotnet4xp/

It should be also be noted that NetChaziz is NOT complete and is in alpha.

(1) "Compatible" in this setence means "clone", as in "IBM PC compatible".


It has been tested on...

Windows 8 Developer Preview Build 8102

Windows 10 Home Insider Preview Build 18298
